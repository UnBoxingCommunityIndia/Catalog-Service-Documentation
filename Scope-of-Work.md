## Introduction

The Catalog Service is a comprehensive digital solution designed to manage and present product information for a wide range of customers. Data presented to the end user is validated by at least 5 users first, after being collected by engineers and scientists. This service facilitates the addition, validation, and display of detailed product specifications, media assets, and performance metrics, making it a centralized hub for product-related data. It supports real-time updates, user engagement through reviews and queries, and detailed product filtering options to enhance customer experience and decision-making.

## Background

In the modern product ecosystem, accurate and organized cataloging of product data is essential for both businesses and consumers. Traditional product catalogs often fail to keep up with real-time changes, such as new product launches, updates, or user feedback. Additionally, many catalogs lack comprehensive multimedia elements like teardown images, showcase videos, and real-world performance data, which are crucial for making informed purchasing decisions.

The Catalog Service of UBC is designed to address these gaps by creating a dynamic, user-friendly platform that allows users to see real-time changes, comprehensive product reviews, and video demonstrations. By ensuring that every product listed is validated and approved, this service aims to offer consumers a trustworthy and transparent source of product data while providing customers with an efficient way to manage their product catalogs.

## Objectives of Catalog Service of UBC

- **Centralize Product Information**: Develop a platform that allows engineers to systematically add, update, and manage comprehensive product details, including specifications, images, videos, and teardown showcases.
- **Facilitate User Validation and Feedback**: Enable users who have used a product to validate or suggest corrections to product specifications, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the catalog data.
- **Enhance Customer Experience**: Provide customers with an intuitive interface to browse, filter, and explore detailed product information, including specifications, performance metrics, and multimedia content, to help them make informed purchasing decisions.
